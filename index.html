                <p>Hello! My name is Eriks. I work at AirBaltic as Junior Digital Integration Specialist, and I have been working hear for around a year. My main work duties are monkey jobs. It was supposed to be different but other project to prioritie and I have no experience in this project so I am reduced to monkey jobs. </p>
                <p>I have learned coding by my self. In the free time that I have between the monkey jobs and I have a lot of free time. I have learned coding mostly from Codecademy website and youtube.</p>
                <p>I am dedicated and willing to learn. I like to get new skills and work on interesting projects. Dedication and open to other options is the way I would describe myself. I can work in a team and like to work with expercts so that I can learn new things and get experince. This is my second project you will se improvments as project count increses.</p>
